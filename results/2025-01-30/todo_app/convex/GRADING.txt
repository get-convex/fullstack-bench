# Interventions
- 08:28: Told it I was still seeing example data.
- 11:27: Told it was seeing a syntax error in the task page with a screenshot.
- 12:18: Told it comments weren't rendering the user email correctly.
- 13:13: Told it the same issue was happening with the assignee dropdown.
- 14:09: Screenshot of React hook rules violation.
- 16:51: Told it the same user issue was happening with the top-left banner.

# Grading
- Membership check for listing all projects a user is a member of
  is incorrect. Hallucinates `.eq` checking if a userID is in
  an array.
  ```
  // Query projects where user is either creator or member
  const projects = await ctx.db
    .query("projects")
    .withIndex("by_member", (q) => q.eq("members", [userId]))
    .collect();
  ```

- All other authorization checks look correct.

# To Fix
- Add UI elements for inviting and removing users from a project
- Add some guidelines for keeping all data fetching out of the components/ directory?
