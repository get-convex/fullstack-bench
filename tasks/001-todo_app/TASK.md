We've sketched out the frontend for a basic TODO app in @project using Next.js and would like to fill out the backend.

- The TODO app supports authentication
- There are multiple projects, and users can create projects.
- Only the project creator can invite other users to the project and remove them.
- Users can only see projects they are a member of.
- Projects can have a name, emoji, and description.
- TODO items belong to a single project.
- Users can only see TODO items in projects they are a member of.
- TODO items can be assigned to a user.
- TODO items can be marked as Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, or Canceled.
- TODO items can have a title, description, and due date.
- Users can see all other users when reassigning a TODO item.
- Comments can be added to a TODO item.
- Comments have an author, content (markdown stored as plain text), and a creation time.
- Comments cannot be edited or deleted.
