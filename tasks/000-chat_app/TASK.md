We've sketched out the frontend for a basic chat app in @project using Next.js and would like to fill out the backend.

- The chat app supports authentication
- There are multiple channels, and all users have access to all channels. Channels have unique names.
- Channels can have messages, and users can post messages into any channel. Messages render in ascending chronological order.
